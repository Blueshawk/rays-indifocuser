# rays-indifocuser
A relatively simple diy telescope focuser driver with a simple backlash adjustment with serial controls.

This focuser is based on an older version R. Brown's focuser-pro and has been modified to include a single backlash setting and serial commands to control it. I use a drv8825 driver board mounted in the power box and connect a single 4 wire cable to stepper motors on several different telescope OTA's.
